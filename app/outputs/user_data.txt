Not related to the post, but funOkay there were 2 Vance t sites in front of our house long time ago. We children used to play there. The houses on either side of the sites got irritated and called the owners of the sites and got them fenced. We grew up. They got grand kids. Now their grand kids don't have a place to play, though these sites are still vacant. They cause commotion in our house parking lot (they have parking lots too, but those mf children don't want to disturb their own family members, but us) confronted them and got them out.After some time, these people used those sites to grow fruits and vegetables, without the permission of the site owner.Just last month the owner came uprooted all of it and cleaned the site. It was very satisfying to watch. Lol
Audit and tax are those papers where they don't see whether your answer is right or wrong. They check whether you know all concepts asked in the question paper. So prepare full syllabus for these two subs. Especially tax. Because in tax each one's answer is different depending g on their perspectives. Give correct assumptions as to why you did or did not apply certain sections in your answers.

Exactly, there are a lot of people trying to leave it fir good and do other shit.. That's why I asked you to post there too.. It'd give them some hope and confidence
I think you can post this on CA sub too.. Many would feel motivated.. And congrats and all the best for your venture
We already have Annavru (Annavru for all kings).. Matte yake Krishnadevaraya? That too Rishab? Of all actors they could choose (or hold audition for a fresh face)...
IT is like training but not in a ca firm. You do it in real corporate companies and it's like you preparing ga job rather than for practice like CA. And it gives a higher pay..
Thanks.. I've been eyeing it fir a long time now but it felt out of budget. Now that I'm convinced it's good imma try it. Thanks.

And it's literally Yash movie. He's the Co producer.. You can do all you want to shade him. But majority are excited for his role,not Ranbir. That's the truth..
Exactly. Some one is not happy 'bout it..
Yesterday I went to a restaurant for dinner. The family sitting beside us was talking about Ramayana, they said "Yash ka Ramayana ka teaser release hua hai" (it was a hindi speaking family) (I was not eavesdropping. They were loud. The tables were close enough. It was a famous restaurant with a tiny space). Which was overtaken by the teen convoy of Squid Game series. So yeah, it's Yash as Ravan which is giving the hype for the movie. Not Ranbir (happened in Bengaluru btw)
It depends.. Search for some. You'll know which one is suitable for you

You may feel your parents have thought that you are a lost cause, but deep down they are very proud of what you've achieved, especially with so much going on..

No, I watched it on prime. I felt bad that I didn't watch it in a theatre after watching it on ott.. These are the types of movies that should become talk of the town..bandidre..

Aww.. Thank you for yourfeedback
Thanks. Saved me some money. How about clarks? Are they good?

I think this is proposed.. Let's wait till it materialises.. Lot of them move away to other states because Karnataka doesn't give as many concessions as others. And there is an opinion that getting permissions in Karnataka is very difficult as officers demand exorbant bribes. Not that officers in other states don't, it's just that demand less...There was a report about this in Prajavani newspaper about a month ago.. It was about "invest Karnataka". How this has benefitted and how much of it actually materialises.. If you can and know kannada please read, it was good and informative..
HMT museum... Nice watch..
That pink looks like it stayed in the sun for ten years and lost all it's colour...
Exactly why asked to keep them private.. The moment you announce people are all excited.. But as the days go by, as the anticipation reduces, there is less than expected audience turn out at the theatre. But your point stands too..
Can we announce movies like music albums? Like don't announce to people what you doing until everything is done. Then one day reveal a title and a flow of events that'll happen over a month and release within the time of hype?That way people are not complaining about the amount of time it's taking for the movie to release and you can make changes to your schedule with responsibility.. Just keep your schedule private, don't make it public
This! Vinay doesn't have great acting skills too,but atleast the stories have some depth and meaning not ' ,' types. Even the heroines have a role in vinay's movies unlike the flower pots in yuva movies..
Passed g1 in may23.. I didn't understand an ounce of GST. When I thought I understood it and attempted questions they used to always be wrong.. So put my heart and soul into DT and studied only for 60 marks. Didn't leave any topic in DT and did the whole shit with sections. In exam hall, solved only DT for 3 hrs reading each and every question carefully, left IDT completely blank. Passed g1 in that attempt with a 40 in taxation. I Really owe it to God for saving me .. Now I'm going through GST, trying to understand the concepts again
A movie in Kannada was released with similar story line.. It was called Pailwan.. It was a very big hit here too..
But I was not amazed as I had already watched Bhoolokam.. And whenever I see someone acting all macho for no reason, I compare them to Bhoolokam especially if they have similar build. My mother finds it funny lol

That land rover - r@nd lover joke is imprented in my head because of that sub
No, that whole movie was a mess. Ravichandran yes. But those heroines were not a match for the movie.

Okay. My mom (she loves movie gossips) has been guessing for a while now that the reason for Sam - Chay divorce is her unwillingness to give birth to a child.. Now I think it's true, because look how Sobi is pregnant within 5 months of getting married..

Your comment shows how much you read.. I said don't point fingers at me meaning you will, which you did.. Read your comment again. If you've picked up so many that too at 17,another won't be an issue at all. And we've not imposed on foreign tourists (idk where you learnt that, lol. But we do have foreigners who've learnt willingly. Heck, a foreign even wrote a English kannada dictionary. Its just propaganda that people like yi are spreading.. Looks very ugly
He has all the money to get into IMD models & talent..
You will never get ahead of you think learning the language of the land you stay in is imposing.. But you would if think it's a skill that'll help you experience the culture and the place and pick it up.
Now don't point fingers at me saying you have not done or have done and shot and all. I know one common language, my mother tongue, three other regional languages of India and now trying to learn a foreign language.Want be a person with skill or go on entertaining yourself doing the monkey gymnastics is your wish..
I wanted to type, but you made it easier..
You're proving again and again that you have a small brain

Okay, I know he's a bad actor.. He better back off and take up full time modelling if possible.. Because that doesn't need him to show a lot of expressions and also can keep his mouth shut. He only needs to squint his eyes and pose to the camera, as simple as that..
Oh.. Science is it? And 81 is no joke.. It's still a good score
Small size brain people don't learn other languages.. They have small brsind and lower neurons.. Lower than that of a mosquito

Pay the service charge, don't tip them.The amount of times I've seen waiters waiting at our table to collect tips when we leave mine is countless.They actually distribute that service charge among themselves (I asked the waiter at the restaurant I regularly visit), so I just don't tip them anymore. The service charge is actually more than what I'd tip, so no tips as they share that service charge amount among themselves...

How to get pirated lectures tho? Dm the route, don't comment here as it would make the tutors aware and cause a lot of damage to the needy.
Yeah, Sony so shit that the screen did not break even when it fell on its screen. And the Service personnel were so bad when the body of the phone was damaged severely (mind you, the phone was still working) imported the parts for us (of course we were ready to pay) when Sony was no more releasing phones in India and repaired it for us. My mom is still using that phone. Only recently the phone developed some screen burns other than that it's still working like butter.So shit that it lastslong.

Your purchase reminded me of my woodland slippers (which were similar but falt) that I bought when I was a teenager. Mf didn't tear off even if I wanted to throw it away ( it was too small for me now) . Lost a veteran. Sent her respectfully by giving it to the garbage collector so someone he knows could use them. I wish she's well taken care of now.
Came across a woman in my chats (I'm a girl) who's doing this and her husband was fine with it. She asked me what do you think about such things? What should I think?

4k display gone, battery life increased. BTW small s teens having 4k is unnecessary, and seemingly the difference is low as seen by the users. So not much to worry about
And it's such a waste to add one just for the genre. It's an action movie, and let it be. We're not or will not be angry of it doesn't have a heroine. Leave it if it's unnecessary.
!
Prashant could rather not include a female protagonist in his story if it's just for a sake of song and 5-6mins of screen time. Would save money in terms of both the heroine's remuneration and the song made just for showing the male protagonist's love life.

The guy in the video has talent.. What does the guy in pic have? Lol
Tell me this is true and not troll.. Please
Is it specific to certain apps or in all in your case?
Not a solution for your problem, but could be for me. Can you please check if your phone is able to record audio while recording the screen? It'd be of great help for me
You mean cropped button downs?The styling looks good.
Maybe it'll come with the update
Ohh, dayumm, okay then. Thank you fir finding out so much info. It was very helpful.
Exactly, that's my question too, but the notification is still there on the icai website. That's why I'm curious
No, I thought I'll find out by e mailing them, i will let you know later
Ohh.. So assistance is quite limited
Just throw it in a nuclear reactor, will keep it charged forever
How's your experience of getting into manipal online?
Do they provide classes or is it self study?
How is it? With respect to online classes and all?
Idk, but I found out they have a mou with icai. I thought someone here woukd know about it and hence asked.
There are people who pronounce "hi-design" as "hide-sign".. When I reached the store I was relieved that I was right that it is "hi-design" as the kannada version was there as well as understood how there are different perspectives to things...
How are you paying online in bus? They never accept for me?
Ohh.. I think that'd be impossible fir me.. I'll search something nearby

Yes, it's good, user friendly too
Ohh.. But waking at 6 minute ght be helpful. And don't sleep late, try to sleep atleast at 10 /10:30. Sleep is important and darkness is as important as light for your body to function properly.
Recording what he speaks should be a good proof to show her parents why she doesn't want to marry him. Ask her record his peaches discreatly and make her parents listen to them.
What is she referring to in the first slide?
This is my current, a photo I took at a flower show
Try, ask your parents if they can help with the process. Make up things if it's needed. What you need is peaceful environment.
If you can consider, just get back to your parents for a few days.
Oh, thank you. Does it depend on the land value too?
I think that's a screen time widget upgraded
I'm actually regretting that I thought it's a small event, I should bought some tickets and sold them in black. Would make good money.
And yes, I'm not using Google software to view it. When I say third party, I mean third party
I've changed it now, and the one in picture was created using so in the wallpaper settings of the phone.
Yeahhh.. Thank god, otherwise I'd think my phone's gone
Samee, I'm so scared about my photos stored on a third party app

And I'm wayy younger than that lollll
I have very weird feeling of happiness.
While solvi g the paper it felt like even the exam setter and icai is fed up of seeing my face every attempt and that's why they set a paper that was my level
This reminded me of boomer bubble gum
That's exactly what I wrote too
Ohh dayumm. But I think curd is always 450 ml. Isn't it? IDk because in my home we make our own, we rarely buy

Exactly, and I have not had kinder joy too..

This too, even he's accomplished in his career, but no, limit him to being her husband.
Exactly. They could name her but decided to call her his wife. No offence, of course she is his wife, but they could recognize her, she's got her own fame too.
Ohh nice.. My average is 218, at current price it's 212..i added it maybe just a countable number of days ago( 4-5)..thatse why

Ohhkay, so intra is fine for this?
If it's gonna fall more, then I'll wait. Thank you.
Actually is there any scope for ireda in future? It has dropped down now, so I'm thinking of buying a few, that's why I'm asking
My question is, will this go further low, so I can really purchase it. For now I'm doing only paper trades, as I had set it for week expiry, it automatically exited when it was priced at 271. I had added 10 units of it when it was 238.Now I want to purchase it for real money, will it go further down, should I wait to buy?
My friends are eating non veg, why are you making me eat eating veg?I dint have a pet, but my future pet will ask me this

You're a random stranger on reddit, not a court to show you proof
For the first one it was proper as usual, the second one was near 350
Near my home we had to fight, that's why resorted to online
Exactly what I told, i mentioned the words 'this pscket'.
Why would I tell about the vessels I have in my home? I thought you people can understand, but no.And not just by eyeyballing packets, I've see first hand how such packing is done. So you don't teach me.
!
If you dint want to believe, don't. It's for informing only. I don't gain anything from rage baiting.
You can try that on solids, not liquids. In that case the packet will not be fluffy with still some air in, but would be stiff like balloon.
My vessel has markings in it, why would I get a bottle? And such small packet can never hold 550 ml milk if in it, it would just burst, and be filled to the rim.
Why would I use a bottle if my vessel has markings in it? I just don't understand what's wrong.. Like how can you think you can fit 550ml in such a clumsy small packet, wouldn't it spill off? Aren't you thinki g about that? Lol
You don't need bottle for this but common sense. How can you fit 550 ml in such a small packet?
I've kept the packets side by side,both are today's only. One 500ml the others says 500 in print but in reality it's way more less
I second this. He was my fav in telugu and guy went downhill after bb series.
Okay. As Mama is famous for a lot of things
And then there's Sony that does not even retail here
As well as keep mamamoo then!
Sony xperias have it classy.. All theses look so porki
That's why I don't recharge until my outgoing service is cut off.. Same with the broadband and the dish too
That was my typo lol.. But WhatsApp is really biased, it needs something added to stupid to generate an image.. Why not just generate a stupid girl image
You're welcome and thank you for your wishes






My mom still refuses to use any phone that's not Sony, tried getting her one she was like bilkul no she's using a Sony Xperia xa1plus btw, which is now facing pixel burns, should get a new phone asap
Sony. Just Sony. Especially for the kind of teck in cameras they have been able to achieve.

Are the cameras really good? Because I read that they are sometimes laggy..
Maroon, chocolate, coffee, dark forest green, dark orange, would make the saree pop

Father's side are pushed forever, mother's side is like having your enemies by your side so that you know what they are doing behind you.. Will be fun if you have some informant within

That's what my mom told too.. Why even get up? Why walk back? He'd come in if he really needed that donation /money or whatever hey were offering him for attending the event..

I've actually never liked recent developments in infra in blr, it's been a reason for a lot of problems in our city. If you are happy that it is turning like this, then be ready for the next Delhi that blr will be, polluted air to breath andwith more asthma patients

Neat! And the stitches look pretty! Pattern please?
I think you need more practice to understand what people are saying.. How do people watch movies that have no stories, it sounds weird. Maybe you are like that, but most are not. And all the old movies you have watched are mostly adopted from novels. It's just the inability of the present directors to do it. Even if they do, they don't accept. And no, both are not different. Books allow you to create your own movie in your brain, movies visualise a directors written story. Today's directors lack story telling together with visualisation. Either they visualise and say a bland story (kgf, kantara) or say a good story and don't visualise heavily (ondu sarala prema kathe, dare devil, mustafa, kadda chitra)Whatever you say when you nt change my opinion, I'm a person who watches for the story and not for last 15-20mins of the movie.

How many have you watched to call "this" a good one saarrr?
It's a picture of you're intestine
Idk the entry fee, but was paid. Yes, sadashivnagar park
I use dumbbells for arms and abs exercise, not cardio , I do walk too for about an hour.
Your opinion is yours,mine is mine.
Story wise kantara was very weak. I was so disappointed after watching the movie for all the hype it got. I hope the prequel has a nice story line.
Yeah.. The one in the residential area, just opposite to the lake
I miss that park that's opposite to the Sankey lake.. Such a nostalgic place for me, many weekends spent there with my parents.. Now it's just some ruins
Ohh.. I used to do low impact cardio followed by legs abs and arms.. I don't have the privilege of going to gym, but I do dumbells. Is this effective too?
Does cardio after weights help to lose fat?
For size don't mind. Our sir always told size doesn't matter, whatever the mark is, it's the content that is important. Write it well.
With the size of your handwriting it'll take this much space ( my handwriting is as huge so I know).. For the section part focus on points relevant to the question first and be specific about words . At the end of the same para you can write those extra points of the section so the examiner knows that you've learnt well. But let them be consise, like just write what you've understood of the rest of the section.
I think that's bloating? Correct me if I'm wrong, sorry in advance

A dermat had recommended zcafy m oil to my dad.. I think you an try it

Ohh.. Thank you for the suggestion
Ohh.. Then I'll get it done there
okay ? Cost limit?
I'm relieved many have it
.
I thought it was a defect
At that rate they make Nintendo switch type phones, like connect them when you need a full sized one and remove the other half when not needed.
But I'm a person uses spilt screen most of the times, so it's useful for me. And hating applet to look cool? Nawww, we don't hate, we criticise it for making small things look like big innovations. If they don't want that ask them to stop it and make a clown of themselves.
Idk, some people who are backward relate it with unpleasant things
Just tell yes and don't do it. You say your husband supports you, do why break your head and spoil your own peace of mind?
Red heels if you don't have stereotypes towards it
Red heels if you don't have stereotypes fur it
Then it's the pants. Not the shirt. A slim fit pant woukdymske or look great
I think it's the pants or the way you posed makes it look baggy
I've not watched oppenheimer but I can take that.. All that hype dropped when I watched barbie.. Only the songs were the best thing fir the movie
I think another 10 years until split screen in iphones
I have not pushed it that hard to be so hot, but maybe a reason
I recently was shooting my mom's cooking with the stove near by, so it maybe due to heat then..
A comment above said it's common in plastic frames.. I think it's true.. I thought the same too, that's why I asked..
Ohh okay.. This is the first time I've had a plastic frame phone. Before I had aluminium framed ones.. Thank you for clarifying
The other phone I have is quiteold and it's unable to capture it.. But I'll try
Oh my.. Like they do exist and visible on back panel?

Hmm.. I'll check this out. thanks.
Ohh.. I though there is one.. Thanks
I think you'll have to use a different pattern for the handle to make look and feel sturdy.. Single pillar crochet is not that great if it's intended for daily use as it won't hold much weight.. Nice pattern though
Where'd you get the gallery app? For 2a
Ohh.. I'll try that too.. Thsnkd
I didn't understand the 2nd point
This is really helpful.. Thank you. I thought I'd invest small.. But as I'm investing parents money I thought it'd be best if I learn at least a few terms and then go ahead.. And just like you said, that's why I'm not following any telegram groups and not yet ready to invest in options too. Thank you for your detailed reply
Ohh.. Thank you for the detailed process
I'm still trying to learn shares.. Thanks for the advice
Thank you.. Is it helpful? Or have you used?
you are not sticking to the topic here..we're arguing about naming schemes if you forgot
easily easier than samsung's naming scheme.. too many letters that don't define what letter is what range except that s series is flagship.. sony is far easier with three numbers that define what is the range and roman numbers that define version..lol
people who are saying blue collared workers can't speak the language, wrong! blue collared workers are far better than these high profile idiots, I have come across lot of blue collared workers working here and learning the language hand in hand. Some have gained proficiency too..it's just that these people are lazy and don't want to learn . ego is in their blood.
what are the other 4 apps? and are they as widely available i.e with the drivers usage ride acceptance like ola?
i think you need to learn to read
why would that excuse not work? just like how people from hindi belt who come here to work don't know kannada, he from a regional state may not know hindi/english. Most people working in this class are normally kannada medium students 10th/12th pass/fail.. just shows hypocris..anyway it's a debate for another dayif it's in the bill that ac should be turned on i think it's only right that they turn it on, when demanded, that's the right thing to do
are you the one who tweeted this? asking because the way you have commented makes it feel like one..

Now we're happily staying in the same place nor has he vacated. The owner is a bit troublesome at times but it's fine, we don't pay heed to it(they stay far off from the rented place, so no headache)

I think you should have alone time with your friend on the phone and tell him everything that's happening. He better knows all these things because if they get married in future there is very high chances that she'll do the same in her in-laws house or even if she's living just with her husband..she seems very selfish..I'm sorry

I've been in this phase..I'm still in it.. in my home,I'm the one who nags my mom for these things she's doing.. WE've had extreme fights because of this.. She says you do whatever you want in your house not here.. I'm waiting when will I make my own home so thatI can finally say "shhh it's over, no more don't do that, don't do this at this okay ?"Now I'm just doing what she says and complying with it other wise it's just a loss of peace of mind for both of us. Anyway we sleep together everyday and share about what happened that day, so yeah
yeah,it has turned into dogshit now
I'm curious. How did watsapp become free all of a sudden?
the presentation of this phone was so good.. it also had lights on the side that lit up when music was being played.. my mom had this..late r she switched to nokia asha (idk the model but it had touch screen with key pad).Later she bought sony xperia m4 aqua
Sony xperia m4 aqua. It was my mom's actually she bought it with the money my granny her given to her. My mom passed it down to me after I passed my 10th. Was going really strong until 3 years ago. It fell on the floor, on one of it's four corners and the screen just went black.. Now I use it as a platform to place my spectacles on it, I don't want to let go of a memory that reminds me of my granny whenever I look at it

>our current stations are coming up where they are sorely needed.i don't think so.. it has become such an eye sore..each to their own I guess.. the whole project took down so much of our eco sysytem..
exactly..you don't need metro for a lot of places in blr if the connectivity is good enough.. metro is such a fad..kolkata did it best by having both tram and metro..using it where they are neede respectfully..here we are digging ground for even not so necessary stations

how can you differentiate? one thing i've obserevd is soem ice creams leave you thirsty after eating them, soem don't ..the ones which leave you thirsty are not ice creams. The ones that don't are ice creams..been eating nandini ice creams from childhood,never left me thirsty. So it is real ice cream. Other brands I'd recommend trying is Ibaco(costyly, gottu. adre parloir expereince andre i go there)

Ajio first time user ( the whole of online shopping actually)I always buy Hidesign products at a hidesign outlet,for the first time I orederd it online (them , actually) and received one order on 19th of aug and the other on 20th aug. Everything was fine.One was a blue sling bag for my mom (got it for almost half the price) another was a wallet for my dad (that too , half the price) . The blue sling bag arrived, my mom was happy until I noticed today the brand's (hidesign)warranty card was not present.And the wallet, the wallet is good. But the delivery was a bit fishy. It was delivered by blue dart. They had to send some otp or something to recite it to the delivery man who then enters it into his record which marks the delivery completed , right? Well, none of this happened. He just stuck the wallet package to the gate, and ran away. In blue dart it marked delivery attempted, but failed due to refusal by consignee or wrong otp, the same was reflected on ajio as well. I informed ajio that the delivery was successful.There is warranty card with the wallet, but it has a spelling mistake.I thought this was mistake and checked it with one of the older warranty cards of other bags I had. There was none in that.Now my brain is thinking I have received some duplicate products.Anybody who has brought hidesign products online please help me.I'd be happy if I'm thinking wrong and it's a genuine product I've received
