Not related to the post, but fun 

Okay there were 2 Vance t sites in front of our house long time ago. We children used to play there. The houses on either side of the sites got irritated and called the owners of the sites and got them fenced. We grew up. They got grand kids. Now their grand kids don't have a place to play, though these sites are still vacant. They cause commotion in our house parking lot (they have parking lots too, but those mf children don't want to disturb their own family members, but us) confronted them and got them out.

After some time, these people used those sites to grow fruits and vegetables, without the permission of the site owner.

Just last month the owner came uprooted all of it and cleaned the site. It was very satisfying to watch. Lol
Audit and tax are those papers where they don't see whether your answer is right or wrong. They check whether you know all concepts asked in the question paper. So prepare full syllabus for these two subs. Especially tax. Because in tax each one's answer is different depending g on their perspectives. Give correct assumptions as to why you did or did not apply certain sections in your answers.

Exactly, there are a lot of people trying to leave it fir good and do other shit.. That's why I asked you to post there too.. It'd give them some hope and confidence
I think you can post this on CA sub too.. Many would feel motivated.. And congrats and all the best for your venture
Omma it's a good thinggg
We already have Annavru (Annavru for all kings).. Matte yake Krishnadevaraya? That too Rishab? Of all actors they could choose (or hold audition for a fresh face)...
IT is like training but not in a ca firm. You do it in real corporate companies and it's like you preparing g फिर a job rather than for practice like CA. And it gives a higher pay..
Jaykayyy
Oh no
What is this? I'm not aware..
Thanks.. I've been eyeing it fir a long time now but it felt out of budget. Now that I'm convinced it's good imma try it. Thanks.

And it's literally Yash movie. He's the Co producer.. You can do all you want to shade him. But majority are excited for his role,not Ranbir. That's the truth..
Exactly. Some one is not happy 'bout it..
Yesterday I went to a restaurant for dinner. The family sitting beside us was talking about Ramayana, they said "Yash ka Ramayana ka teaser release hua hai" (it was a hindi speaking family) (I was not eavesdropping. They were loud. The tables were close enough. It was a famous restaurant with a tiny space). Which was overtaken by the teen convoy of Squid Game series. So yeah, it's Yash as Ravan which is giving the hype for the movie. Not Ranbir 🙂🙂(happened in Bengaluru btw)
No.. But they say it's reputed
It depends.. Search for some. You'll know which one is suitable for you

I think this is proposed.. Let's wait till it materialises.. Lot of them move away to other states because Karnataka doesn't give as many concessions as others. And there is an opinion that getting permissions in Karnataka is very difficult as officers demand exorbant bribes. Not that officers in other states don't, it's just that demand less...

There was a report about this in Prajavani newspaper about a month ago.. It was about "invest Karnataka". How this has benefitted and how much of it actually materialises.. If you can and know kannada please read, it was good and informative..
Yeah, I should.. 😊

Exactly why asked to keep them private.. The moment you announce people are all excited.. But as the days go by, as the anticipation reduces, there is less than expected audience turn out at the theatre. But your point stands too..
Can we announce movies like music albums? Like don't announce to people what you doing until everything is done. Then one day reveal a title and a flow of events that'll happen over a month and release within the time of hype?

That way people are not complaining about the amount of time it's taking for the movie to release and you can make changes to your schedule with responsibility.. Just keep your schedule private, don't make it public
This! Vinay doesn't have great acting skills too,but atleast the stories have some depth and meaning not 'ಹೋದ್ಯ ಪುಟ್ಟ, ಬಂದ್ಯಾ ಪುಟ್ಟ' types. Even the heroines have a role in vinay's movies unlike the flower pots in yuva movies..
Passed g1 in may23.. I didn't understand an ounce of GST. When I thought I understood it and attempted questions they used to always be wrong.. So put my heart and soul into DT and studied only for 60 marks. Didn't leave any topic in DT and did the whole shit with sections. In exam hall, solved only DT for 3 hrs reading each and every question carefully, left IDT completely blank. Passed g1 in that attempt with a 40 in taxation. I Really owe it to God for saving me 🙏🙏.. Now I'm going through GST, trying to understand the concepts again
A movie in Kannada was released with similar story line.. It was called Pailwan.. It was a very big hit here too..
But I was not amazed as I had already watched Bhoolokam.. And whenever I see someone acting all macho for no reason, I compare them to Bhoolokam especially if they have similar build. My mother finds it funny lol

Pay the service charge, don't tip them.

The amount of times I've seen waiters waiting at our table to collect tips when we leave mine is countless.

They actually distribute that service charge among themselves (I asked the waiter at the restaurant I regularly visit), so I just don't tip them anymore. The service charge is actually more than what I'd tip, so no tips as they share that service charge amount among themselves...

Yeah, Sony so shit that the screen did not break even when it fell on its screen. And the Service personnel were so bad when the body of the phone was damaged severely (mind you, the phone was still working) imported the parts for us (of course we were ready to pay) when Sony was no more releasing phones in India and repaired it for us. My mom is still using that phone. Only recently the phone developed some screen burns other than that it's still working like butter.

So shit that it lasts  long.
Yeah, that's true

Your purchase reminded me of my woodland slippers (which were similar but falt) that I bought when I was a teenager. Mf didn't tear off even if I wanted to throw it away ( it was too small for me now) . Lost a veteran. Sent her respectfully by giving it to the garbage collector so someone he knows could use them. I wish she's well taken care of now.
Came across a woman in my chats (I'm a girl) who's doing this and her husband was fine with it. She asked me what do you think about such things? What should I think? It's about her morality and her relationship, not related to me isn't it? I slowing stopped chatting with her. It def was creepy chatting with her

4k display gone, battery life increased. BTW small s teens having 4k is unnecessary, and seemingly the difference is low as seen by the users. So not much to worry about
So? Solved? Any update?
And it's such a waste to add one just for the genre. It's an action movie, and let it be. We're not or will not be angry of it doesn't have a heroine. Leave it if it's unnecessary.

Prashant could rather not include a female protagonist in his story if it's just for a sake of song and 5-6mins of screen time. Would save money in terms of both the heroine's remuneration and the song made just for showing the male protagonist's love life.

My question is, will this go further low, so I can really purchase it. For now I'm doing only paper trades, as I had set it for week expiry, it automatically exited when it was priced at 271. I had added 10 units of it when it was 238. 

Now I want to purchase it for real money, will it go further down, should I wait to buy?

And not just by eyeyballing packets, I've see first hand how such packing is done. So you don't teach me.

If you dint want to believe, don't. It's for informing only. I don't gain anything from rage baiting.
You can try that on solids, not liquids. In that case the packet will not be fluffy with still some air in, but would be stiff like balloon.
My vessel has markings in it, why would I get a bottle? And such small packet can never hold 550 ml milk if in it, it would just burst, and be filled to the rim.
Why would I use a bottle if my vessel has markings in it? I just don't understand what's wrong.. Like how can you think you can fit 550ml in such a clumsy small packet, wouldn't it spill off? Aren't you thinki g about that? Lol
You don't need bottle for this but common sense. How can you fit 550 ml in such a small packet?
I've kept the packets side by side,both are today's only. One 500ml the others says 500 in print but in reality it's way more less

Some people are posting all the best wishes under some posts today 🥲🥲
Neat! And the stitches look pretty! Pattern please?
Thank you
Lovely.. What's the pattern?
Your intestine
I think you need more practice to understand what people are saying.. How do people watch movies that have no stories, it sounds weird. Maybe you are like that, but most are not. And all the old movies you have watched are mostly adopted from novels. It's just the inability of the present directors to do it. Even if they do, they don't accept. And no, both are not different. Books allow you to create your own movie in your brain, movies visualise a directors written story. Today's directors lack story telling together with visualisation. Either they visualise and say a bland story (kgf, kantara) or say a good story and don't visualise heavily (ondu sarala prema kathe, dare devil, mustafa, kadda chitra)

Whatever you say when you nt change my opinion, I'm a person who watches for the story and not for last 15-20mins of the movie.
Idu kelsa ildoru maadodu. Kelsa iroru swalpa movies aste nodiyu chennagirodu yavdu, ilde irodu yavdu anta gurtu hisitaare. Comics, books odorige bega ne gottagutte, yav kathe gatti yavdu tollu anta.
How many have you watched to call "this" a good one saarrr?
It's a picture of you're intestine
Idk the entry fee, but was paid. Yes, sadashivnagar park
I use dumbbells for arms and abs exercise, not cardio , I do walk too for about an hour.
😂😂 I never knew this name
I second this
Your opinion is yours,mine is mine.
Story wise kantara was very weak. I was so disappointed after watching the movie for all the hype it got. I hope the prequel has a nice story line.
Yeah.. The one in the residential area, just opposite to the lake
I miss that park that's opposite to the Sankey lake.. Such a nostalgic place for me, many weekends spent there with my parents.. Now it's just some ruins 😔😔
Ohh.. I used to do low impact cardio followed by legs abs and arms.. I don't have the privilege of going to gym, but I do dumbells. Is this effective too?
Does cardio after weights help to lose fat?
For size don't mind. Our sir always told size doesn't matter, whatever the mark is, it's the content that is important. Write it well.
With the size of your handwriting it'll take this much space ( my handwriting is as huge so I know).. For the section part focus on points relevant to the question first and be specific about words . At the end of the same para you can write those extra points of the section so the examiner knows that you've learnt well. But let them be consise, like just write what you've understood of the rest of the section.

That looks like a apple 5V

.
I thought it was a defect
At that rate they make Nintendo switch type phones, like connect them when you need a full sized one and remove the other half when not needed.
But I'm a person uses spilt screen most of the times, so it's useful for me. And hating applet to look cool? Nawww, we don't hate, we criticise it for making small things look like big innovations. If they don't want that ask them to stop it and make a clown of themselves.
LOL
There is adhaar payment option
Nice
Idk, some people who are backward relate it with unpleasant things
Just tell yes and don't do it. You say your husband supports you, do why break your head and spoil your own peace of mind?

I have not pushed it that hard to be so hot, but maybe a reason
I recently was shooting my mom's cooking with the stove near by, so it maybe due to heat then..
A comment above said it's common in plastic frames.. I think it's true.. I thought the same too, that's why I asked..
Ohh okay.. This is the first time I've had a plastic frame phone. Before I had aluminium framed ones.. Thank you for clarifying
The other phone I have is quite  old and it's unable to capture it.. But I'll try

I wish my parents could be this tolerant of such things
I'm a ligayat.. So I know first hand to what extent all this is practised.. 😂😂 the practise is almost non existent.. Our people are ditching their own practices and embracing others' practices..

Ohh.. I though there is one.. Thanks
I think you'll have to use a different pattern for the handle to make look and feel sturdy.. Single pillar crochet is not that great if it's intended for daily use as it won't hold much weight.. Nice pattern though

Ohh.. Thank you for the detailed process

Okay, thanks again
Thank you.. Is it helpful? Or have you used?

you are not sticking to the topic here..we're arguing about naming schemes if you forgot

my mom too
easily easier than samsung's naming scheme.. too many letters that don't define what letter is what range except that s series is flagship.. sony is far easier with three numbers that define what is the range and roman numbers that define version..lol
people who are saying blue collared workers can't speak the language, wrong! blue collared workers are far better than these high profile idiots, I have come across lot of blue collared workers working here and learning the language hand in hand. Some have gained proficiency too..it's just that these people are lazy and don't want to learn . ego is in their blood.
what are the other 4 apps? and are they as widely available i.e with the drivers usage ride acceptance like ola?
can you dm them to me?
i think you need to learn to read
why would that excuse not work? just like how people from hindi belt who come here to work don't know kannada, he from a regional state may not know hindi/english. Most people working in this class are normally kannada medium students 10th/12th pass/fail.. just shows hypocris..anyway it's a debate for another day

I think you should have alone time with your friend on the phone and tell him everything that's happening. He better knows all these things because if they get married in future there is very high chances that she'll do the same in her in-laws house or even if she's living just with her husband..she seems very selfish..I'm sorry

She says you do whatever you want in your house not here.. I'm waiting when will I make my own home so that  I can finally say "shhh it's over, no more don't do that, don't do this at this okay ?"

Now I'm just doing what she says and complying with it other wise it's just a loss of peace of mind for both of us. Anyway we sleep together everyday and share about what happened that day, so yeah

I'm curious. How did watsapp become free all of a sudden?
the presentation of this phone was so good.. it also had lights on the side that lit up when music was being played.. my mom had this..late r she switched to nokia asha (idk the model but it had touch screen with key pad).Later she bought sony xperia m4 aqua

Sony xperia m4 aqua. It was my mom's actually she bought it with the money my granny her given to her. My mom passed it down to me after I passed my 10th. Was going really strong until 3 years ago. It fell on the floor, on one of it's four corners and the screen just went black.. Now I use it as a platform to place my spectacles on it, I don't want to let go of a memory that reminds me of my granny whenever I look at it
ohh..
Looks like are mods are salty about someone buying something in Benagaluru.. Apprently this is a sub only for complaining about the city, not to provide info about the city,be it anything

betabuxxers means?
>our current stations are coming up where they are sorely needed.

i don't think so.. it has become such an eye sore..each to their own I guess.. the whole project took down so much of our eco sysytem..
exactly..you don't need metro for a lot of places in blr if the connectivity is good enough.. metro is such a fad..kolkata did it best by having both tram and metro..using it where they are neede respectfully..here we are digging ground for even not so necessary stations
lake revival if there are any left by the time they start the project..river revival seems impossible as almost all  the buildings on it's banks are dependent on it for drainage..would take a lot of work to deviate them and then start the work
BR is the worst I've had..it's so chewy
how can you differentiate? one thing i've obserevd is soem ice creams leave you thirsty after eating them, soem don't ..the ones which leave you thirsty are not ice creams. The ones that don't are ice creams.. 

been eating nandini ice creams from childhood,never left me thirsty. So it is real ice cream. Other brands I'd recommend trying is Ibaco(costyly, gottu. adre parloir expereince andre i go there)

Okay. I know a lot of you here are sony lovers

What about the 10's ? like nobody buying the 10's? or the 10's ain't expressing themselves? I want to know how the 10's are because I want to buy a 10 v..

2) Mr.Y and Mr.z ageed to cancel 50% each of their respective total debt including interest on debentures . Y& Z also agreed to pay rs 1 lakh & 60 thousand respectively in cash and to recieve new 12% debentures for the balance amount.

what would be the journal entry for these adjustments?

Which one should I buy?
I'm new to the car world. My family will be buying a car within the coming months.

A few months back I was pretty sure that we would buy a nexon after the facelift (I was the one who convinced them to do that , smh)

Now I'm confused as even the new elevate of Honda is appealing to me.

should I go with nexon or elevate ( looking for manual, petrol)

pros and cons of both in your opinion would be appreciated .

Ajio first time user ( the whole of online shopping actually)
 

I always buy Hidesign products at a hidesign outlet,

for the first time I orederd it online (them , actually) and received one order on 19th of aug and the other on 20th aug. Everything was fine.

One was a blue sling bag for my mom (got it for almost half the price) another was a wallet for my dad (that too , half the price) . The blue sling bag arrived, my mom was happy until I noticed today the brand's (hidesign)warranty card was not present.

And the wallet, the wallet is good. But the delivery was a bit fishy. It was delivered by blue dart. They had to send some otp or something to recite it to the delivery man who then enters it into his record which marks the delivery completed , right? Well, none of this happened. He just stuck the wallet package to the gate, and ran away. In blue dart it marked delivery attempted, but failed due to refusal by consignee or wrong otp, the same was reflected on ajio as well. I informed ajio that the delivery was successful.

There is warranty card with the wallet, but it has a spelling mistake.

I thought this was mistake and checked it with one of the older warranty cards of other bags I had. There was none in that.

Now my brain is thinking I have received some duplicate products.

Anybody who has brought hidesign products online please help me.

I'd be happy if I'm thinking wrong and it's a genuine product I've received
